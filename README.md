### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Senior Software Engineer that is passionate about creating accessible and intuitive developer experiences. I hope my side projects â€” ranging from fun integrations to quirky, creative tools â€” and my professional work embody my philosophy of bringing joy to users. Outside of work, my love for D&D, painting, and music often inspires my projects. As a remote worker, I embrace collaborating across distances while maintaining a strong connection to my team.


### Fun
In my spare time I have created a few fun side projects like:

* [Streamkiwi](https://streamkiwi.netlify.app/) - A way to get an overview of all the people you are following on Twitch, and when they were going to stream next.
* [Onoes](https://onoes.netlify.app/) - Fun pomodoro timer that is cute!
* [WhatGenre](https://whatgenre.netlify.app/) - Using Spotify's API it checks what genre a given artist has.
* [PastelDeck](https://pasteldeck.netlify.app/) - A cute slideshow generator. 
* [Spotify to Slack](https://github.com/khendrikse/spotify-to-slack) - Inspired by msn statusses from back in the day. You can run it locally to sync the song you're listening to on Spotify with your Slack status.
* [Oob-this](https://oob-this.netlify.com/) -A small website that replaces each vowel in a word with 'oob'.
